# 💡 Java Programming Challenges

Welcome to the **Java Programming Challenges** folder!  
This section contains my solutions to various **Java coding problems** — from beginner-friendly exercises to intermediate algorithmic challenges.

Each file demonstrates my approach to problem-solving, use of Java fundamentals, and incremental progress in logic building.

## 🧠 Purpose

This folder serves as:
- A personal **practice log** to improve my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking  
- A **reference guide** for learners exploring Java challenges  
- A demonstration of how I apply **OOP**, **loops**, **conditionals**, and **data structures** in solving problems

## 🧩 My Problem-Solving Thought Process

Every challenge follows a clear logical framework I use across all programming languages:

1. **Identify Inputs and Outputs**  
   - Understand what data is given and what needs to be produced.  
   - Define the goal before writing any line of code.

2. **Decide How to Handle Input**  
   - Will I use a `Scanner` for user input, or are values predefined?  
   - This step ensures I plan how data enters the program.

3. **Plan the Logic Flow**  
   - Break down the process using **conditional statements**, **loops**, or **OOP concepts**.  
   - Ask questions like:  
     - “Do I need to check conditions?”  
     - “Do I need to repeat actions?”  
     - “What data structure fits best?”

4. **Implement Step-by-Step**  
   - Translate the plan into code.  
   - Keep it clean and test small parts as I go.

5. **Produce and Verify Output**  
   - Display results in the correct format.  
   - Test different inputs to confirm accuracy and handle edge cases.

### 🚀 Goal
To continuously refine my logic-building skills and strengthen my foundation in **Java programming**, one challenge at a time.
