## 📚 Repository Overview

This repo includes:
- Basic Java syntax and examples  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts  
- Practice problems and mini projects  
- Notes and code snippets for quick reference  

It serves both as a personal study log and a reference for others learning Java basics.

## 📖 Learning References

This repository is based on the concepts and exercises I’ve learned from the following courses:

🎓 Java Programming Masterclass — Udemy
 by Tim Buchalka

🎥 Bro Code – Full Java Course for Beginners (YouTube)


Both courses have helped me grasp Java fundamentals and improve my coding confidence through hands-on examples.

## 🌱 Future Plans

Add more OOP-focused exercises

Implement small projects (e.g., calculator, student records, etc.)

Explore file handling, exceptions, and collections
